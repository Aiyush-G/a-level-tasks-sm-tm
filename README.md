<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Repo
Over the next two years, my mini-projects / experiments completed in task will be stored in this repo as a way to make reference to it / look back on it etc...

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There are quite a few different projects in the repo and to run them, there are a few different requirements:

### Prerequisites - Noughts and Crosses
Arcade is a pygame-like library that adds some extra functionality, my main reason for trying it out was to see how it compared as a PyGame alternative. It being my first project with the library resulted in a very verbose result ~~(that contains a healthy amount of spaghetti code)~~. 
  ```sh
  python3 -m pip install arcade
  ```

### Running Noughts and Crosses
```sh
  python3 main.py
```

### Prerequisites - Hexadecimal, Binary, Denary Converted
Given the project brief, the only modules that could be used must be graphical and must not aid the logic of the conversion itself, hence its' just PySide6 (https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/).
  ```sh
  python3 -m pip install PySide6
  ```

### Running Hexadecimal, Binary, Denary Converted
```sh
  python3 hbd_gui.py
```

### Prerequisites - 90, 60 Second Tasks
Nothing extra needed! Just Python! (written with 3.9 but any version > 3) will work. Just quick introductory programs that had to be written at the start of the year.

### Prerequisites - Simple Code Snippets
Tiny code-blocks where I've tested some basic things ie. recursion etc...
