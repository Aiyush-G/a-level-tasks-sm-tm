Using the compute shader, you can use the GPU to perform calculations thousands
of times faster than just by using the CPU.

In this example, we will simulate a star field using an 'N-Body simulation'. Each
star is effected by each other star's gravity. For 1,000 stars, this means we have
1,000 x 1,000 = 1,000,000 million calculations to perform for each frame.
The video has 65,000 stars, requiring 4.2 billion gravity force calculations per frame.
On high-end hardware it can still run at 60 fps!

How does this work?
There are three major parts to this program:

* The Python code, this glues everything together.
* The visualization shaders, which let us see the data.
* The compute shader, which moves everything.

Visualization Shaders
---------------------

There are multiple visualization shaders, which operate in this order:

.. image:: shaders.svg

The Python program creates a **shader storage buffer object** (SSBO) of
floating point numbers. This buffer
has the x, y, z and radius of each star stored in ``in_vertex``. It also
stores the color in ``in_color``.

The **vertex shader** doesn't do much more than separate out the radius
variable from the group of floats used to store position.

The **geometry shader** converts the single point (which we can't render) to
a square, which we can render. It changes the one point, to four points of a quad.

The **fragment shader** runs for each pixel. It produces the soft glow effect of the
star, and rounds off the quad into a circle.

Compute Shaders
---------------

This program runs two buffers. We have an **input buffer**, with all our current data. We perform
calculations on that data and write to the **output buffer**. We then swap those buffers for the
next frame, where we use the output of the previous frame as the input to the next frame.

Python Program

Read through the code here, I've tried hard to explain all the parts in the comments.
